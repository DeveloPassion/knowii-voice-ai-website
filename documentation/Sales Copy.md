## Your Reality Right Now

You're writing an email.

You know exactly what you want to say. The words are RIGHT THERE in your head.

But your fingers can't keep up.

So you type. Delete. Retype. Check for typos. Fix autocorrect disasters.

Five minutes later, you've written three sentences.

**This happens dozens of times every single day.**

When you're documenting that complex feature you just built.

When you're responding to customer support tickets at 4pm and your brain works but your fingers are done.

When you're taking notes in a meeting and missing important points because you're too busy typing the last thing that was said.

The worst part? You KNOW what you want to say. The bottleneck isn't your brain.

It's your keyboard.

---

## Picture This Instead

You're writing that same email.

You press and hold Ctrl+Shift+G.

You speak, naturally, like you're talking to a friend: "Hey Sarah, I looked into the issue you mentioned and found the root cause. It's happening because..."

You release.

The words appear. Exactly where your cursor is. Exactly what you said.

No cloud processing. No spinning wheel. No waiting.

Just done.

**You just wrote three paragraphs in the time it took to type three sentences.**

Your fingers never touched the keyboard.

---

## How It Actually Feels To Use This

Morning standup notes. You speak them while sipping your coffee.

Slack messages. Spoken while you're reviewing a pull request with your other hand on the mouse.

That blog post you've been putting off for weeks. Suddenly you're 800 words in and it's been twelve minutes.

Commit messages. Code comments. Documentation. Email responses.

All of it, just... flowing. At the speed of thought.

**Here's what changes:**

You stop dreading writing tasks.

That documentation you've been avoiding? You knock it out in your first coffee of the day.

Those customer emails piling up? You clear them in half the time, and they're more thoughtful because you're not exhausted from typing.

Your meeting notes are actually useful now because you caught everything, not just fragments.

You finish your writing-heavy tasks by 2pm instead of 6pm.

You have energy left over.

---

## What This Actually Is

Knowii Voice AI is voice-to-text that runs entirely on your computer.

Press one keyboard shortcut. Speak. Release.

Your words appear exactly where your cursor is.

In any application. Gmail. Slack. VS Code. Notion. Your terminal. Literally anywhere.

**Everything happens on your machine.**

Your voice never leaves your computer.

No internet required after you download the AI model once.

No monthly fee. No usage limits. No tracking.

You pay $49 once. You own it forever. Every update, every new feature, included.

It's voice-to-text done the way it should have been done from the start.

---

## The Details That Matter

### It works everywhere

Not "works in most apps" or "works in Chrome."

Everywhere.

Your code editor. Your email client. Your chat apps. Your browser. Your note-taking app. That weird legacy business tool your company makes you use.

If you can type in it, you can speak in it.

### It's actually private

Your voice recordings stay on your hard drive.

The AI model that transcribes your voice runs locally on your computer.

No servers. No cloud processing. No API calls. No data leaving your machine.

When I say private, I mean private.

### It respects your clipboard

You know how other tools paste by copying to your clipboard, which means you lose whatever you had copied?

Knowii Voice AI saves your clipboard before pasting, then restores it after.

Your workflow stays intact.

### You can hear when it starts and stops

Subtle audio cues when you start recording and when you stop.

You always know when it's listening.

Pick from different sound themes, or use your own audio files.

### Your history is searchable

Every transcription is saved locally and searchable.

Star the important ones. Search through months of transcriptions in milliseconds.

Edit any transcription. Delete the audio file but keep the text to save space.

Double-click any old transcription to copy it again.

It's not just a transcription tool. It's your external memory.

**[📸 SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: History page]**
*Show the history view with the search bar highlighted, a few starred items, date groupings expanded, and the audio player visible on one item*

### You control which AI model to use

Download the small, fast model if you want near-instant results.

Download the large, accurate model if you're transcribing technical content or accents.

Switch anytime. The app manages everything.

Models load when you need them, unload when you don't.

Your memory, your choice.

## Who This Is Really For

### You write code for a living

Documentation takes forever to write and you avoid it.

Code comments feel like a chore.

Commit messages end up rushed and vague.

Pull request descriptions are copy-pasted templates.

**With this:** You speak your documentation while reviewing your own code. Your commit messages are detailed because speaking is effortless. Your PR descriptions actually explain the context because it takes 30 seconds to speak it, not 10 minutes to type it.

### You write content

Blog posts. Articles. Scripts. Social posts.

You stare at the blank page because the gap between thought and text is exhausting.

You have ideas, but getting them into words drains you.

**With this:** You speak your first draft like you're explaining it to a friend. Editing is easy. It's the getting started that this fixes. Suddenly you're 1,200 words deep and wondering where the last 15 minutes went.

### You communicate for work

Emails. Slack. Teams. Support tickets.

By noon you've typed 5,000 words and your hands hurt.

By 3pm you're abbreviating responses because you're tired of typing.

**With this:** Your responses are faster and more thorough because speaking doesn't drain you like typing does. You clear your inbox in half the time. You leave work with energy.

### You care about privacy

You've read the terms of service.

You know what "we may use your data to improve our models" means.

You're not interested in your voice recordings training someone's AI.

**With this:** Your data is your data. On your machine. Under your control. No compromises.

## Questions You're Probably Asking

**Does this really work offline?**

Yes. After you download the AI model once (it's a one-time thing), everything runs on your computer. Your laptop could be in airplane mode and it would still work perfectly.

**What if I don't have a great microphone?**

Your laptop's built-in mic works fine. I use mine with a cheap headset mic. The AI models are good at handling imperfect audio. Obviously better mics help, but you don't need to buy anything special.

**How fast is it?**

Depends on your computer and which model you pick. On a decent laptop with the small model, you'll get results in 1-3 seconds. With GPU acceleration, it's near-instant. Larger models take a few seconds longer but are more accurate. There's a model for every preference.

**Does it work in [my language]?**

If Whisper supports it, yes. That includes English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and dozens more. You pick your language in settings.

**What's the catch with Early Access?**

There's no catch. The product works now. I'm calling it Early Access because I'm actively building new features based on user feedback. You get to help shape what gets built next, and you get the lowest price it will ever be.

**Can I use this for work?**

Yes. This is a commercial license. Use it for personal projects, professional work, client communications, whatever you need.

**What if I have problems?**

Email me. I respond to every message. If something's broken, I'll fix it. If something's confusing, I'll help. You're not alone.

**Will the price go up?**

Yes, when it leaves Early Access. If you buy now at $49, you lock in lifetime access at this price. No future charges, ever.

**What's your refund policy?**

30-day money-back guarantee. If you don't like it, email me and I'll refund you. No argument, no hassle.

## Why I Built This

Hey, I'm Sébastien.

I'm a developer, writer, and indie maker.

I've used every voice-to-text tool out there. Cloud services that cost $20/month. Browser extensions that only work in Chrome. Mobile apps that don't talk to my computer.

They all had the same problems:

They sent my voice to someone else's servers. They cost money forever. They had usage limits. They only worked in specific apps.

I wanted something different.

Something that respects privacy. Something I could own, not rent. Something that works everywhere.

So I built Knowii Voice AI.

It runs entirely on your computer. You pay once and own it forever. It works in literally every application.

I'm not VC-backed. This isn't a startup that'll get acquired and shut down.

It's just me, building tools I want to exist in the world.

Tools that respect users instead of extracting from them.

If that resonates with you, I'd love for you to try it.

— Sébastien

## Implementation Notes

### Visual Placeholders Strategy

**Hero video (Critical)**
The most important visual. Show the complete workflow: press, speak, release, text appears. Keep it under 30 seconds. No voiceover needed - the action speaks for itself. Show it being used in a real application (VS Code, Gmail, etc), not a demo app.

**History page screenshot**
Demonstrate the searchable history feature. Show it populated with real-seeming transcriptions, not lorem ipsum. Include starred items, expanded date groups, the search bar, and the audio player on one item.

**Models management screenshot**
Show 3-4 models with different sizes, some downloaded, one downloading with progress bar. This proves you can choose and manage models easily.

**Onboarding video**
Quick walkthrough showing download → setup wizard → first transcription. Should feel effortless. Maximum 90 seconds.

**Roadmap visual**
Simple, clean visualization of upcoming features. Could be a timeline, card layout, or simple list with icons. Don't overdesign this.

**Your photo**
Friendly, approachable, real. Not a corporate headshot. This is about building trust with a human, not a company.

### Writing Style Notes

**Voice and tone:**
- Conversational, like explaining to a friend over coffee
- Reader-focused ("you" not "we")
- Specific and vivid (paint pictures)
- Honest about Early Access status
- Confident but not arrogant
- Warm but professional

**What works:**
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Generous line breaks (breathing room)
- Active verbs (speak, press, release, not "allows you to")
- Specific nouns (keyboard, cursor, clipboard, not "interface elements")
- Benefits over features (save time vs. fast processing)
- Questions as headers (mirrors reader's thoughts)

**What to avoid:**
- Exclamation points (used only 4 times in entire copy)
- Marketing jargon ("revolutionary," "game-changing," "innovative")
- Vague claims (specific numbers and examples instead)
- Feature lists without context
- Corporate speak
- Hype

### Conversion Elements

**Trust builders:**
- 30-day money-back guarantee (mentioned 3 times)
- Personal founder story (human connection)
- Honest about Early Access status
- Specific about what you're getting
- Direct support from the creator

**Urgency (subtle):**
- Price will increase post-Early Access
- Early adopter benefits
- Shape the product's future
- No pushy countdown timers or fake scarcity

**Risk reversal:**
- 30-day guarantee
- No subscription lock-in
- Pay once, own forever
- Try it properly before committing

### A/B Testing Opportunities

**Headlines to test:**
- "You Think Faster Than You Type" (current)
- "Stop Fighting Your Keyboard"
- "Your Brain Works. Your Fingers Don't."

**CTA text to test:**
- "Try it risk-free for 30 days - $49" (current)
- "Get Knowii Voice AI - $49 (No subscription)"
- "Own it forever - $49 one-time"

**Price framing to test:**
- "$49, once" (current)
- "$49 one-time payment (vs. $180-360/year for alternatives)"
- "Less than $5/month if you use it for a year (but you own it forever)"

### SEO Keywords (Natural Integration)

Primary: voice to text, speech to text, offline transcription, voice typing software

Secondary: local voice recognition, privacy voice transcription, whisper AI desktop, dictation software offline, voice to text no subscription

Long-tail: voice to text that works in any app, offline voice typing for developers, private speech recognition software

Keywords are naturally integrated into copy without forcing or stuffing.

### Objection Handling Map

| Objection | Where It's Handled |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Does it really work offline?" | FAQ section |
| "Is my data private?" | Multiple sections, core value prop |
| "Will it work in my apps?" | "Works everywhere" section |
| "What if my mic is bad?" | FAQ section |
| "Is Early Access reliable?" | FAQ + honest positioning throughout |
| "What if I have problems?" | FAQ + founder's note |
| "Will price increase?" | FAQ + subtle urgency |
| "Can I get a refund?" | FAQ + 30-day guarantee repeated |

Every major objection is anticipated and handled before the reader has to ask.
