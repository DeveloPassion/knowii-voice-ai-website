## Here's What You Already Know

Typing is slow.

You have a thought. It's fully formed. Clear. Ready to be written.

But getting it from your brain to the screen takes forever.

Your fingers hunt for keys. Autocorrect changes words you didn't want changed. You stop to fix typos. You lose your train of thought.

**The average person types 40 words per minute.**

You speak at 150 words per minute.

That's not a small difference. That's nearly 4x faster.

But here's the thing: every voice-to-text solution you've tried has been broken in some way.

They only work in Chrome. Or they send your voice to the cloud. Or they cost $20/month forever. Or they're inaccurate. Or they're a pain to use.

So you keep typing.

Even though you know there's a better way.

---

## What If It Actually Worked?

Imagine opening your email client tomorrow morning.

You see a message that needs a thoughtful response. The kind that would normally take you ten minutes to type carefully.

You press Ctrl+Shift+G.

You speak your response, naturally, like you're talking to the person: "Thanks for reaching out about this. I've been thinking about the same thing, and here's what I think we should do..."

Thirty seconds later, you release the key.

Your response is there. Complete. Thoughtful. Well-structured.

You read it once, make a tiny edit, and hit send.

**Two minutes total. You just saved eight minutes.**

Now multiply that by every email, every Slack message, every piece of documentation, every blog post, every code comment you write in a week.

How many hours would you get back?

---

## This Already Exists

It's called Knowii Voice AI.

It's voice-to-text software that runs entirely on your computer.

One keyboard shortcut. Any application. Complete privacy.

Here's how it works:

**Press and hold Ctrl+Shift+G.**

The app starts recording your voice. You'll hear a subtle sound so you know it's listening.

**Speak naturally.**

Like you're talking to someone. Don't slow down. Don't enunciate weirdly. Just talk.

**Release the key.**

The AI transcribes your words (on your computer, offline) and pastes them exactly where your cursor is.

**That's it.**

No cloud. No lag. No usage limits. No monthly fee.

Works in Gmail, Slack, VS Code, Notion, your terminal, Microsoft Word, Discord, literally any application where you can type.

## What Makes This Different

### You actually own it

Pay $49 once. Use it forever.

Every update, every new feature, included.

No subscription. No usage caps. No "premium tier."

### Your data stays yours

The AI models run on your computer, not in the cloud.

Your voice recordings are saved locally.

Nothing leaves your machine. No tracking. No telemetry. No API calls.

When you delete a recording, it's actually deleted. Not "archived for compliance." Deleted.

### It works in every app

Not just Google Docs. Not just Chrome.

Every. Single. Application.

Because it pastes at the system level, not through a browser extension or API integration.

If you can put your cursor there and type, you can speak there instead.

### Your clipboard doesn't get destroyed

Other voice-to-text tools paste by copying to your clipboard.

Which means whatever you had copied gets replaced.

Knowii Voice AI saves your clipboard, pastes the transcription, then restores your clipboard.

Your workflow isn't interrupted.

### You can see everything you've ever said

Every transcription is saved and searchable.

Need to find that thing you said three weeks ago? Search for it.

Want to copy an old transcription again? Double-click it.

Need to clear space? Delete the audio files but keep the text.

## Who Uses This

**Sarah, technical writer**

Writes documentation for developer tools. Used to spend 6+ hours a day typing. Now speaks her first drafts in half the time, spends the saved hours editing and improving structure instead of fighting her keyboard.

**Marcus, support lead**

Responds to 40+ customer emails daily. Was getting RSI from typing. Now speaks his responses while reading the customer's issue. Cut his response time in half and his wrist pain is gone.

**Jamie, indie developer**

Hated writing commit messages and PR descriptions. They were always rushed and vague. Now speaks detailed explanations in 30 seconds while the context is fresh. Team reviews are smoother because everyone actually understands what changed and why.

**You, tomorrow**

Instead of typing this document you're working on, you speak it.

Instead of hunting for keys while your brain is three sentences ahead, your words flow at the speed of thought.

Instead of ending your day with tired hands and a sore neck from looking down at the keyboard, you finish with energy.

That's what changes.

---

## How It Actually Works (Technical Details)

Knowii Voice AI uses Whisper and Parakeet AI models.

These are state-of-the-art speech recognition models. The same technology that powers professional transcription services, but running locally on your computer.

You download the model once (2-10 GB depending on which model you choose).

When you record your voice, the audio stays on your computer and gets transcribed by the local AI model.

No internet required. No cloud API. No sending your voice anywhere.

If your computer has an NVIDIA GPU, transcription is accelerated and near-instant.

If you're on CPU-only, it takes a few seconds. Still fast enough to be useful.

You can choose between multiple models based on your priorities:

**Small models** - Fast, near-instant results, good accuracy

**Medium models** - Balanced speed and accuracy

**Large models** - Slower but more accurate, great for technical content or accents

Switch between them anytime. The app manages loading and unloading automatically.

## Common Questions

**Is this actually private?**

Yes. Everything runs on your computer. Your voice recordings are stored locally. The AI model runs locally. Nothing is sent to any server. You can run it with your internet connection disabled and it works perfectly.

**Does it work offline?**

Yes, completely. You need internet once to download the AI model (2-10 GB depending on the model). After that, it works offline forever.

**How accurate is it?**

Very. Whisper and Parakeet are among the best speech recognition models available. Accuracy depends on audio quality, background noise, and which model you use. Larger models are more accurate but slower. In practice, it's accurate enough for daily use without constant corrections.

**What languages work?**

All major languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and many more. You select your language in settings.

**Will this work on my computer?**

If you're running Windows 10/11 or Linux, yes. macOS support is coming. You don't need a powerful computer, but GPU acceleration helps (NVIDIA CUDA). It works fine on CPU-only systems, just a bit slower.

**What microphone do I need?**

Whatever you already have. Built-in laptop mics work. USB mics work. Headset mics work. Better microphones produce better results, but you don't need to buy anything special.

**Can I customize the keyboard shortcut?**

Yes. The default is Ctrl+Shift+G, but you can change it to whatever you want in settings.

**What about my clipboard?**

The app saves your clipboard before pasting, then restores it after. Your copied content isn't lost.

**How fast is transcription?**

With GPU acceleration and small models: near-instant (1-2 seconds). On CPU with larger models: 3-5 seconds. Fast enough to feel seamless in normal use.

**Can I use this at work?**

Yes. Commercial license included. Use it for personal projects, professional work, client communications, whatever you need.

**What if I have problems?**

Email me. I'll help. If something's broken, I'll fix it. If something's confusing, I'll explain it. You're not alone.

**Will the price increase?**

Yes. This is Early Access pricing. When the product leaves beta, the price will go up. Buy now to lock in $49 forever.

**What's your refund policy?**

30 days, no questions asked. If you're not happy, email me for a full refund.

## The Numbers

Average typing speed: 40 words per minute

Average speaking speed: 150 words per minute

**You speak 3.75x faster than you type.**

If you write for 2 hours per day:
- Typing: 4,800 words
- Speaking: 18,000 words

That's 13,200 more words in the same time.

Or: accomplish the same 4,800 words in 32 minutes instead of 2 hours.

**You get back 88 minutes per day.**

7.3 hours per week.

That's nearly a full workday you're not spending typing.

Over a year, that's 380 hours.

What would you do with an extra 380 hours?

---

## What It Costs

**Most voice-to-text services:**

$15-30 per month, forever.

That's $180-360 per year.

Over five years: $900-1,800.

Plus, you don't own it. Stop paying, lose access.

Plus, your voice goes to their servers.

Plus, usage limits and throttling.

**Knowii Voice AI:**

$49, once.

Own it forever.

All updates included.

Complete privacy.

No usage limits.

**The difference over five years: $851-1,751 saved.**

## Why I Built This

I'm Sébastien, a developer and writer.

I tried every voice-to-text tool. Dictation software, browser extensions, mobile apps, cloud services.

They all had problems I couldn't ignore.

Cloud services sent my voice to servers. I didn't like that.

Browser extensions only worked in Chrome. I work in multiple apps.

Mobile dictation didn't sync to my computer. Useless for my workflow.

Desktop software cost $200+ or had subscriptions. And still sent data to the cloud.

I wanted something simple:

Runs on my computer. Works everywhere. Respects privacy. Affordable, one-time cost.

That didn't exist.

So I built it.

Knowii Voice AI is what I wanted to exist in the world.

Privacy-first. User-owned. No subscriptions. No compromises.

If you've been frustrated by the same things, this is for you.

— Sébastien

## Implementation Notes for Version B

### Key Differences from Version A

**Approach:**
- Version A: Empathy-first, paints detailed emotional pictures
- Version B: Logic-first, leads with data and efficiency gains

**Headline:**
- Version A: "You Think Faster Than You Type" (aspirational)

**Opening:**
- Version A: Starts with reader's emotional experience
- Version B: Starts with what they already know (validates their experience)

**Proof strategy:**
- Version A: Emotional benefits and lifestyle changes
- Version B: Numbers, time savings, specific user stories

**Tone:**
- Version A: Warm friend explaining something helpful
- Version B: Confident expert showing you a better way

**Structure:**
- Version A: Problem → Solution → Feelings → Product → Close

- Efficiency-focused first, privacy as important but secondary

**Or A/B test both** and let the data decide.

### Visual Placeholders

**Version B hero video:**
Split-screen comparison showing typing vs. speaking, with visible time difference. More analytical, less emotional than Version A's satisfied smile focus.

**User story cards (optional addition):**
If you want to add visuals, create simple cards with photos and quotes from Sarah, Marcus, and Jamie. Make them feel real, not stock photos.

**Time savings calculator (interactive element idea):**
"How much time would YOU save?"
Input: Hours spent writing per day
Output: Hours saved per week/month/year with 3.75x speed boost

### Copy Style Notes

**Version B characteristics:**
- More numbers and specific data
- Shorter paragraphs (even more concise than A)
- Direct statements over questions
- "Here's what happens" vs "imagine what happens"
- Proof through specifics, not feelings
- Still conversational but more assertive

**Maintained from Version A:**
- Generous line breaks
- Minimal exclamation points
- Benefits over features
- Reader-focused language
- Active verbs
- Specific nouns
